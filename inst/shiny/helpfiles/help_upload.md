**uploading your traktor sets**

`deejae` needs information about your sets to work (which means you should visit this app from the machine you use for DJing). hit *BROWSE* to explore your files and find your **traktor history** (stored as a collection of .nml history playlists automatically generated for each of your sessions). the exact location depends on where you keep your [**Traktor Root Directory**](https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/210274225-What-Files-and-Folders-does-TRAKTOR-Install-on-my-System-), but by default the path is:

- `OS X: Macintosh HD > Users > *Username* > Documents > Native Instruments > Traktor *Version Number* > History`
- `Windows: C: > Users > *Username* > My Documents > Native Instruments > Traktor *Version Number* > History`

you should select all of the history playlists you want to explore this time, and then press *Open* from your file explorer screen. if the upload is successful, you will see a *history file(s) uploaded* pop-up, and can now explore your DJ sets.

**privacy**

this project does not store any data you upload beyond temporary files necessary for the app to function, while you're using it (this does mean you will need to re-upload your history, the next time you visit).
